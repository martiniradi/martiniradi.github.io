  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.francesco-corman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Prof. Francesco Corman's</a> group at the <a href="https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Institute for Transport Planning and Systems (IVT)</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ETH Zurich</a>. 
Prior to this, I conducted my doctoral studies in Operations Research at <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DTU</a>, advised by <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/dario-pacino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Dario Pacino</a> and <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/stefan-r%C3%B8pke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Stefan Ropke</a>, which included a research stay at the <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>, hosted by <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/alexandre-jacquillat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat</a>.
In my research, I develop decomposition-based methods for large-scale optimization applied to transportation and logistics. My current projects involve collaborative maritime logistics and on-demand public transit systems.
